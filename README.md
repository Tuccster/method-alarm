# method-alarm
An alarm that, when triggered, prompts the user to solve a C# coding problem to turn it off.

# Current state of the repository
As of right now, all I've uploaded to github are just the C# files that make up the project to show the work I've put into the project so far. This project is still very much a work-in-progress and will upload all the files once the program is more user-friendly.

# What are some of the features that work?
- Command line parser:
  *Takes input from the user and parses the data to be passed to the command's respective method*
  
- Window docking:
  *Docks the editor to the top of the console window, moving the editor when the console window moves

- Custom problems:
  *Create custom problems by editing a single file!*

# Future plans
- As it sits, this application isn't complete and a new user would not be able to figure out how to use it, so the goal is to get the project to a working, easy to understand state. 
- I would really like to add support for playing music from Spotify at some point
